clusion of that war, Caesar left him there as governor of
Numidia, in which capacity he is charged with having greatly
oppressed and plundered the people. Sertaiu it is, that though
he was governor but one year, he amassed enormous wenlth.
The Numidiam charged him with maladministration, aud threat
erred him with a prosecution for extortion; but through the
influence of Caesar, who is said to have received a portion of
the plunder, he was allowed to escape. He theu retired from
public life, and with the wealth thus acquired he purchased
a villa at Tibur, and laid out, on the Quirinalis, in the suburbe
of Rome, those magnificent gardens which were afterwards
called horti Sallustiani. 'Phe beauty of these gardens bas been
much celebrated, and after the death of Sallust they became
the retreat of successive emperors down te the time of Aure·
lirinus. ln his villa at Tibur or iu the splendid palace sur-
rounded by his gardens, Sallust spent the close of his life in
literary retirement; aud it is more thau probable that here
also he composed those historical worhs on which his reputation
depende. The story that he married Terentia, the divoroed wife
of Cicer0, rests ori insufficient authority. He died in B. C. 34
The two great political parties in Rome were the populares,
or popular party, embracing the great mass of the plebs, and
sometimes an ambitione patricias, like Caesar3 and the opti·
mites, or aristocratic party, comprising the senam, the patri·
cians, the young nobility, and the chief part of the equites;
who had almost exclusively filled the chief offices of govern-
ment. Sallust was a warm supportet of the popular party, and
his strong dislike for the aristocracy, particularly of its younger

braueh, frequently shows itself in his writings. After his ex· ζ

pulaion from the senate he probably repaired to Gaesar’s quar·
ters in Gaul, and shared the fortunes ci that great commander.
The extant works of Sallust are two historical trectises on

selected porticus of Roman history: the Cutiliae, or Bellum
Ooldbtart'um, which unfolds ths origin, progress, arrd suppres-
sion of the conspiracy of Catilina, of which Sallust was himself
an eye-witness3 and the Japartta, or Bellum Jupurrhiaam,
which describes the varying fortune and the final success of the
Romans in their war with J ugurtha, the wily king of Numidia
