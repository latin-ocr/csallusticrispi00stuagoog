has therefore been deemed proper, while avoiding the
widest departures from established usage, to retain what
may be fairly considered the leading and distinctiva fea·

Although the Catilina was unquestionably written
before the J ugurtha, the worhs have been arranged iu

events narrated in the text, and give a sense of reality
to the student's comprehension of them.

The present edition (1885) hasbeen revised through·
out; the notes have been rewritten, and those on the
Catilina have been somewhat enlarged ; while the Vo-
oabulary has been reduced to a better working capacity
by the omission of a number of the more remote defi-
nitions. Experienca proves that, in respect to defini·
tions, brevity and exaetness aoeure the student the
most rapid progreas.
