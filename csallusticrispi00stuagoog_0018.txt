x Mau 01? SALLUST.

Sallust's residence in that country probably suggested the work
tobim, and enabled him to collect materials for ia Resides
these, Sallust also wrote a Roman History in five books, of
which, however, butafew disoonnected fragments romain. These
works, aa previously stated, were probably all written after his
retirement from public life, though the composition of each of
them has been assigned to widely different dates.

Sallust bas always been regarded as a charming writer.
Among Roman authors he is certainly unsurpassed in the art
of historioal composition. His style is one altogether peculiar,
and is characterized by a sententious brevity. He is the most
concise among the Roman writers of the golden age. With
him style was evidently a matter of primary importance He
made Thucydides his model, and studied a pointed style, ren·
dered more forcible by antithesis and oontrast. There is this
difference, however, between the Greek and the Roman: “The
brevity of Thucydides is the result of condensati0n3 that of
Sallust is elliptioal expression. He gives ahint, and the reader
must supply the rest3 whilst Thucydides only expects his
readers to unfold and develop ideas which already existed in a
conoeutrated form. Sallust requires addition3 Thucydides dilu-

He is perhaps over fond of certain antique forms and modes
of expression, and clings too tenaciously to the old orthography
at a time when the new was becoming very generally adopted.
Yet “ in the Catilina and J ugurtha there is not a single word
used which is not also of frequent occurrence in contemporary
and luter writers.'' (Manuale.) Niebuhr remarks that Sallust

“ “preserves the old phraseology with a predilection guided by
learning and judgment‚’' and Aulus Gellius speaks of him as
“ proprietatum in verbis retinentissimus.'' His attempt to imi·
tate, rather than follow the bent of his own genius, not unfre-
quently develops in his style more of art than of nature, and
more artistic polish than native ease and grace.

Sallust’s private character was a subject of controversy in
ancient as it has.also been in modern times, and different
opinions have been formed in regard toit. The first permanent
allusion to it grew out of the bitterness and animosity of parti·
